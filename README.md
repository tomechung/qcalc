# qcalc

This is mainly a convenience function in R in order to calculate inter-rater reliability found in [Putka, Le, McCoy, and Diaz (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18808219). Inter-rater reliability is commonly calculated in the context of organization research where ratees are examined by several independent raters. The calculation of coefficient q is most pertinent in situations where the research design is "ill-structured." That is, when raters do not rate all ratees (i.e., fully crossed) but also ratees are not exclusively rated by a particular rater (i.e., fully nested).
